<h1 style="text-align: center;">BenBotOS<span>&trade;</span></h1>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>BenbotOS<span>&trade; features are built for automation. From semi-automatic, like the Smart Tunneling and Bridging app, which automatically takes care of the action and finishes, to fully automatic applications like the tree farm application, that keep going forever until stopped, there is no shortage of automation.<br /></span></p>
<h2>Ease of use</h2>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>The install process for BenBotOS<span>&trade; is very simple. If you get your hand on an install disk, it can be installed on any robot running openOS by running the program attached. It even runs on top of openOS for maximum speed and reliability.</span></p>
<h3><span>General Usage</span></h3>
<p><span>&nbsp;BenBotOS&trade; is itself just an addition to openOS. Meaning that BenBotOS&trade; behaves exactly like openOS. All programs on BenBotOS&trade; do not require any complicated arguments, and instead only require simple questions instead.</span></p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>BenBotOS<span>&trade; is completly open source. You can even contribute to it!</span></p>
