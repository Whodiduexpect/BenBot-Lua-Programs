# BenBotOS

## How to make programs for BenBot™

### Naming
The program needs to be named with no spaces, instead, capitalize every starting letter in a word. For example, GoodJep and BadJep are both valid program names.

### Beginning
The beginning of the program is the place to ask the user questions about what they want to do. Make sure to include a print statement.  

### End
Make sure the program ends with the first slot selected, otherwise this might cause issues with other programs.

## How do I update?
If your using Benbot™ X, using the Update program in the /home directory will automaticly update the Programs directory.

## Is this the entire OS?
No, of course not, it's only the stuff that got updated. By adding something in the repository, the Update program will override/modify the installed OS with the file from the repository.
