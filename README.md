Lua programs for BenBot™
## How to make programs for BenBot™

### Naming
The program needs to be named with no spaces, instead captiliaze every starting letter in a word. For example, GoodJep and BadJep are both valid program names.

### Beginning
The beggining of the program is the place to ask the user questions about what they want to do. Make sure to include a print statement.  

### End
Make sure the program ends with the first slot selected, otherwise this might cause issues with other programs.
